Files to build the PicoMite. MMBasic running on the Raspberry Pi Pico

NB: This should be built against pico-sdk version 1.2. 
However, the version of TinyUSB in SDK1.2 must be replaced by TinyUSB 0.7.0
This also requires changes in the SDK directories src/rp2_common/pico_stdio_usb and src/rp2_common/tinyusb
The amended versions of these is included in the files provided
